## Introduction

Logistic regression is a powerful and widely used classification algorithm in machine learning. This repository showcases various aspects of logistic regression, from data preparation to model evaluation.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is a critical step in the machine learning pipeline. In this section, I demonstrate techniques to preprocess and clean datasets to ensure high-quality inputs for the models.

## Model Building

This section covers the implementation of logistic regression models, highlighting different approaches and techniques used to build and refine the models.

## Model Evaluation

Evaluating the performance of a model is crucial. Here, I use various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess the effectiveness of the logistic regression models.

## Future Work

I plan to expand this repository with more advanced techniques and applications related to logistic regression, including regularization methods, multinomial logistic regression, and model optimization.

Thank you for exploring my logistic regression project. I hope you find it insightful and valuable!
